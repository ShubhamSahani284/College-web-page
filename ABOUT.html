<h7>DR.Santhosh kumar G</h7>
						<P>I welcome you all to East West College of Engineering. The main aim of every educational institution would be ‚Äòto convert the mind into a living fountain and not a reservoir. That which is filled by pumping in, will be emptied by pumping out‚Äô. A teacher affects eternity; he or she can never tell where his or her learning stops. Thus, the mediocre teacher tells, the good teacher explains, the superior teacher demonstrates, the great teacher inspires‚Äô. Education in the widest sense includes everything that exerts formative influence and causes a young person to be what he is at a given point. Educational institutions should not be simply ‚Äòinformation supermarkets‚Äô; instead they should shape and mould human beings. At East West College of Engineering, we take immense pride in the fact that our students receive the best quality education. This is made possible by following very high standards of teaching and learning.
Our excellence is not just confined to the classroom; we are also notably active in conducting conferences, workshops, seminars, guest lectures and other co-curricular activities. These activities expose students to aspects beyond the curriculum, 
The students graduating from our institute will have diverse knowledge and skills in the areas of their studies and will have a broad understanding of industry and societal needs.. It specially says that ‚Äúwhat worked yesterday won‚Äôt work tomorrow. Our motto is, "Quality & Acadimic Excellence in Engineering Education‚Äù.</P>
