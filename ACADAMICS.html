		<h4>Academics</h4>
		<p style="text-align:center">We align to the single-minded pursuit of Excellence</p><br>
		<p4>Education is the main building block of a happy, fruitful, and productive life.<br><br>
			Nelson Mandela famously said that, ‚ÄúEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world‚Äù. This famous quote about education has inspire many, as do many other great education quotes and academics quotes.<br><br>
			A well-rounded schooling framework prepares children for the future. However, math, science, and geography alone won't set you up for real life. Teachers also encourage their students to have an independent mind and to become free thinkers. One way to encourage this way of thinking is by sharing academics quotes with children and young people.<br><br>
			Mahatma Gandhi's famous line advises us to, "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." We believe this is the best motto in education, as not only does it stress the importance of learning, it also shows the need to enjoy yourself along the way. You will find this quote and all the rest of the best education quotes in this article!<br><br>
